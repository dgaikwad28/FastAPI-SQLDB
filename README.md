### FastAPI-SQLDB Project

This project is a FastAPI application designed to interact with a SQL database. It includes error handling, session management, and host verification.

#### Features
- **Database Integration**: Automatically creates all necessary tables at startup using SQLAlchemy models.
- **Error Handling**: Custom handlers for different exceptions including validation errors and uncaught exceptions.
- **Session Management**: Uses session middleware to manage user sessions securely.
- **Host Verification**: Ensures that all requests come from a list of trusted hosts.

#### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FastAPI-SQLDB.git
   cd FastAPI-SQLDB
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**
   - Ensure the `app/configs/settings.py` file has the correct settings for your environment.
   - Create `env/.env` and update based on th template  `env/example.env`.
        ```bash
         cp example.env .env
       ```

4. **Run the Application**

   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

#### Usage
- The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- Use routes defined under `app/routers/router.py` to interact with the application.

#### API Documentation
- Swagger UI can be accessed on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

#### Development
- Add new API routes by extending `app/routers/router.py`.
- Add new models in `app/models/db_models.py` and ensure they are imported in `main.py`.

#### Testing
- Run tests using your preferred testing framework integrated into your IDE.

#### Deployment
- Configure production database settings and host details in `app/configs/settings.py`.
- Deploy using a WSGI server like Gunicorn and a reverse proxy like Nginx.
